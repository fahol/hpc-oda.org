summary: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC24) - Birds of a Feather on Operational Data Analytics
abstract: |-
  Operational data analytics (ODA) provides unique opportunities to analyze,
  understand, and optimize operations of HPC systems. Readily available
  open-source frameworks make the collection of monitoring data from different
  domains of the HPC system increasingly easy. However, making the data work
  for HPC operations is not straightforward and HPC sites are duplicating
  efforts to develop methods and tools to analyze and leverage the data.
  AI-based analysis methods are appealing, but certainly not the only option.
  This BoF aims to bring together practitioners in HPC operations to share use
  cases for ODA, discuss problems and provide feedback.
