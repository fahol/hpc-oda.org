abstract: As we move into the exascale era, supercomputers grow larger, denser, more
  heterogeneous, and ever more complex. Operating such machines reliably and efficiently
  requires deep insight into the operational parameters of the machine itself as well
  as its supporting infrastructure. To fulfill this need, early adopter sites have
  started the development and deployment of Operational Data Analytics (ODA) frameworks
  allowing the continuous monitoring, archiving, and analysis of near realtime performance
  data from the machine and infrastructure levels, providing immediately actionable
  information for multiple operational uses. To understand their ODA goals, requirements,
  and use cases, we have conducted a survey among eight early adopter sites from the
  US, Europe, and Japan that operate top 50 high-performance computing systems. We
  have assessed the technologies leveraged to build their ODA frameworks, identified
  use cases and other push and pull factors that drive the sites' ODA activities,
  and report on their operational lessons.
