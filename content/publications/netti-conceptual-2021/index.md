abstract: 'This paper provides a broad framework for understanding trends in Operational
  Data Analytics (ODA) for High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. The goal of
  ODA is to allow for the continuous monitoring, archiving, and analysis of near real-time
  performance data, providing immediately actionable information for multiple operational
  uses. In this work, we combine two models to provide a comprehensive HPC ODA framework:
  one is an evolutionary model of analytics capabilities that consists of four types,
  which are descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive, while the other
  is a four-pillar model for energy-efficient HPC operations that covers facility,
  system hardware, system software, and applications. This new framework is then overlaid
  with a description of current development and production deployments of ODA within
  leading-edge HPC facilities. Finally, we perform a comprehensive survey of ODA works
  and classify them according to our framework, in order to demonstrate its effectiveness.'
