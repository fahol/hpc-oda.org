The HPC Operational Data Analytics community continues to grow its digital infrastructure, with team member Woong Shin taking the lead on developing a modern webpage using the Hugo static site generator. This initiative represents a significant step forward in creating a centralized hub for community resources, documentation, and collaborative tools.

Hugo's performance-focused architecture makes it an ideal choice for the technical nature of our community's content. The framework's ability to handle complex documentation structures while maintaining fast load times aligns perfectly with the data-driven approach that defines HPC ODA work. Shin's implementation focuses on creating an intuitive user experience that will serve both newcomers seeking to understand operational data analytics and experienced practitioners looking to share insights and best practices.

The new webpage will feature dedicated sections for project updates, technical resources, meeting documentation, and community contributions. This centralized platform aims to strengthen collaboration between HPC centers worldwide and provide a lasting repository of the community's collective knowledge and experience.

This effort is an example of the collaborative spirit that drives the HPC ODA community forward, demonstrating how individual contributions create value for the entire ecosystem. The webpage development is expected to be showcased during upcoming monthly community calls, where members can provide feedback and suggestions for additional features.
